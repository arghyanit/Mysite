summary: Invited talk at **CPOD 2018** 
abstract: Fluctuations of conserved quantities such as net-baryon, net-charge, and   net-strangeness number have generated considerable interest in the study of the thermodynamic properties of the hot and dense QCD matter. Theoretical calculations suggest that the off-diagonal cumulants of conserved charges along with the diagonal cumulants can help better constrain the freeze-out parameters and therefore help to map the QCD phase diagram. We  present the 2nd-order off-diagonal cumulants of net-charge, net-proton, and net-kaon multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions from the RHIC BES-I program in the energy range of = 7.7-200 GeV. We also present the centrality and the acceptance ($\eta$) dependence of the cumulants. The measured cumulant ratios are compared with the predictions from both thermal (HRG) and non-thermal (UrQMD) models.
