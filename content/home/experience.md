  Thesis advisor: [Prof. Tapan Kumar Nayak](https://nayak.web.cern.ch/nayak/index.html)

  Funded by DAE-VECC

  Research focus: 

  * Study the properties of quark-gluon-plasma to hadronic phase transition through cumulant analysis of particle multiplicity distribution.
  * Developed automated and efficient tool to correct detector efficiency for cumulant analysis in multiple bins.
  * Simulation study to understand various background on fluctuation analysis.
  * Estimation of isothermal compressibility at chemical freezeout temperature at heavy-ion collision.
